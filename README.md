Python Game Theory Simulation: Prisoner's Dilemma
Project Overview
This repository contains a Python simulation of the classic game theory scenario: the Prisoner's Dilemma. This is a fascinating study of strategic decision-making where two individuals must independently decide whether to cooperate or defect, and their choices significantly impact their outcomes.

In this game theory scenario, the individuals are represented as players in a Python program. The program offers the choice to play against the computer or to simulate a game between two automated Python players that follow different strategies.

Features
The program contains the following features:

A detailed description of the game theory situation.
A visual representation of the possible outcomes for all combinations of choices.
A dictionary that assigns points to each possible outcome.
User interaction: the program asks the user whether they want to participate in the game.
Automated gameplay: the program can simulate a game between two Python players with different decision-making strategies.
Error handling: the program controls for incorrect input from the user.
Multiple runs: the program can run the simulation between two Python players multiple times and declares a winner based on the cumulative results.
